I’m Atul Phadke, a Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. I build AI-driven biomedical software, full‑stack applications, and advanced analysis pipelines.

At Mass General Hospital’s Gene and Cell Therapy Institute, I engineered CAP‑GENIE, a multi‑platform sequencing analysis suite (Python, C++, AWS) with Cython‑optimized modules and multithreaded computation capable of processing over 2 million reads per second, reducing runtime by 40%. I also developed an AI/ML protein motif analysis pipeline (PyTorch, scikit‑learn) that achieved 95% accuracy in detecting functionally relevant motifs.

At Northeastern University’s Center for Translational Neuroimaging, I led the development of neuroimaging pipelines and a cloud‑based Flask web app for DTI, fMRI, and QUTE‑CE data processing, improving throughput and analysis time by 92%. I also implemented a method for blood‑brain barrier permeability quantification using QUTE‑CE MRI, integrating C++ and Python for image reconstruction and segmentation.

I’m excited about problems at the intersection of biotechnology and computer science and enjoy shipping reliable, scalable tools that accelerate research and discovery.
