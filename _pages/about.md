I’m Atul Phadke, a Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. I build AI-driven biomedical software, full‑stack applications, and advanced analysis pipelines.

I’m excited about problems at the intersection of biotechnology and computer science and enjoy shipping reliable, scalable tools that accelerate research and discovery.
