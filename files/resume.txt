Software Engineer Intern 
●  Engineered CAP-GENIE analysis suite across CLI, web, and desktop platforms using Python, C++, Electron, 
JavaScript, Flask, and AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch), implementing Cython-optimized sequence parsing, 
multithreaded C++ modules with OpenMP capable of processing over 2M reads/sec, reducing runtime by 40%. 
●  Developed an AI/ML protein motif analysis system using PyTorch and Scikit-learn, integrating ESM2/ProtBERT 
embeddings, HDBSCAN/UMAP clustering, and Random Forest models, achieving 95% accurate retrieval of 
functionally relevant motifs. 

Northeastern University – Center for Translational Neuroimaging      
Software Engineer Intern 
●  Led development of end-to-end neuroimaging pipelines for DTI, fMRI, and QUTE-CE analysis using Python, C++, 

        Feb 2021 – Mar 2024 | Boston, MA 

Bash, and MATLAB, improving processing throughput and read accuracy of the flagship by 92%. 

●  Co-created CTNI cloud-based web application with Flask and AWS, supporting visualization, preprocessing, image 

● 

analysis, and postprocessing workflows, reducing processing time by 35%. 
Implemented a novel AI-driven method for Blood-Brain Barrier permeability quantification using QUTE-CE MRI, 
integrating C++ and Python for image reconstruction and segmentation.
