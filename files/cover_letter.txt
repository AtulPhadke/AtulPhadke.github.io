I am writing to express my interest in the [Position Title] position at [Company Name], as advertised 

on [Job Board or Company Website]. I am a Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience major 

at Northeastern University with  experience building AI-driven biomedical software, full-stack 

applications, and advanced analysis pipelines. My background intersects biotechnology and 

computer science, aligning closely with [Company Name]’s mission to [mention company focus or 

goal brieﬂy].

During my internship at Mass General Hospital’s Gene and Cell Therapy Institute, I engineered 

CAP-GENIE, a multi-platform sequencing analysis suite built with Python, C++, and AWS. This system 

incorporated optimized Cython modules and multithreaded computation capable of processing over 

2 million reads per second, reducing runtime by 40%. I also developed an AI/ML protein motif 

analysis pipeline using PyTorch and scikit-learn that achieved 95% accuracy in detecting functionally 

relevant motifs.

During my internship at Northeastern University’s Center for Translational Neuroimaging, I led the 

development of neuroimaging pipelines and a cloud-based Flask web app for DTI, fMRI, and 

QUTE-CE data processing, improving runtime and analysis time by 92%. These experiences 

strengthened my technical foundation and my ability to deliver reliable, scalable solutions that 

accelerate research and discovery.

I am eager to contribute my computational and analytical skills to [Company Name], where I can help 

develop cutting-edge solutions in [brieﬂy describe company’s focus area or project type]. Thank you 

for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Atul Phadke
